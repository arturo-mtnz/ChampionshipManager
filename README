----- USAGE -----

Swagger API accessible from: http://localhost:5000/swagger/index.html 

A sequence of endpoint calls should be followed. This is the expected order:

STEP 1 - Create four teams (POST /api/teams):

[
	{
	  "name": "A",
	  "strength": 0
	},
	{
	  "name": "B",
	  "strength": 30
	},
	{
	  "name": "C",
	  "strength": 70
	},
	{
	  "name": "D",
	  "strength": 100
	}
]

STEP 2 - Matchmaking  (POST /api/matchCreation): automatically generates the 6 matches of the group stage.

STEP 3 - Simulate  (POST /api/simulation)

STEPS 4 & 5 - Get final standings (GET /api/standings) or qualified teams (GET /api/teamsQualifiedForKnockoutStage)


 ----- ADDITIONAL NOTES -----

- DELETE /api/simulation can be used to reuse the same teams for another simulation. STEP 2 should be executed next.
- Stores teams and matches can be accesed anytime from the corresponding GET endpoints.
